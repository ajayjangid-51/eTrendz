Ecommerce Online Store

I developed this E-Commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application features a user-friendly interface that allows customers to browse and purchase products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete transactions using a secure checkout process.

I implemented server-side rendering with Express.js to improve the performance and SEO of the website. I used MongoDB to store the product and user data, and used Mongoose for data modeling and validation.

I also Implemented an Admin panel for the store owner to manage their products, view orders, and manage customers.

I integrated Stripe API for handling secure online payments and used Redux for managing the application's state. Additionally, I implemented a search feature and filtering options to help users quickly find the products they are looking for.

The application was designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, making it easy for customers to shop on any device. The goal of this project was to create an efficient and user-friendly e-commerce platform that can be easily scaled and customized for different business needs.

During the development of the e-commerce web application using the MERN stack, I encountered several notable accomplishments and challenges:

##Accomplishments:

1.Successfully implemented a secure checkout process using Stripe API.
2.Developed an admin panel that allows the store owner to manage their products, view orders, and manage customers.
3.Implemented server-side rendering with Express.js to improve the performance and SEO of the website.
4.Successfully integrated search feature and filtering options to help users quickly find the products they are looking for.

##Challenges:

1.Implementing the secure checkout process and ensure that it was PCI compliant.
2.Implementing a scalable and efficient way to manage a large number of products and orders.
3.Ensuring that the application was responsive and mobile-friendly.
4.Managing the state of the application using Redux, in a way that is performant and maintainable.


Overall, the development of this project was a challenging but rewarding experience, and it allowed me to improve my skills in web development, especially in e-commerce and server-side rendering.
